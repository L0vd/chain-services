# Umee


##### Overview
Umee is the most programmable, safety-first lending algorithm built as a blockchain. As a base layer blockchain, applications and money lego primitives can be built on top of Umee to access cross chain leverage, liquidity, and debt instruments. The Umee Blockchain facilitates interoperability between the Cosmos ecosystem, Ethereum, side chain architectures, layer two scaling solutions, rollups, and alternative base layer protocols.
